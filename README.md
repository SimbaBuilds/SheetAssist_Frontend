This the front end of SheetAssist, an AI spreadsheet assistant, reachable at sheetassistapp.com

The back end of this application features an LLM writing and executing code in a sandbox environment, similar to ChatGPT's "code interpreter" tool. However, the algorithm on the backend of this application adds a verification layer to ensure that the output will satisfy the user's query, not just be the output of error free code.
